**Project Title: IPL Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis**

**Description:**

This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of an IPL (Indian Premier League) dataset. The analysis focuses on understanding player performance, identifying key statistics, and visualizing trends within the data.

**Key Highlights:**

**Player Performance Analysis:**

	Identified players with maximum matches played in a season.
	Determined top players based on average scores, considering factors like half-centuries.
	Analyzed player strike rates and compared them to the league average.
	Evaluated players with high averages, strike rates, and balls faced.
	Identified players with at least one century and those with at least four half-centuries.
	Discovered players with high boundaries and sixes count.
	Determined top 10 players with the most runs in a season.
	Calculated and analyzed player's not out percentages.

**Data Cleaning and Transformation:**

	Cleaned the 'Highest Score' column by removing asterisks and converting it to an integer.
	Created new columns for player first names and last names.

**Statistical Analysis:**

	Calculated the total number of centuries scored.
	Performed correlation analysis between features and visualized it using a heatmap.
	Calculated percentage of total runs scored in 4s and 6s.

**Data Visualization:**

	Generated a histogram of the number of matches played.
	Generated a histogram of the balls faced by players.
	Created visualizations for players with centuries.
	Created visualization of the top 10 players with highest number of sixes.
	Created a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between runs scored and balls faced.
